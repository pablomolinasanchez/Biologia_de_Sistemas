abstract = {Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder whose genetic influences remain elusive. We hypothesize that individually rare structural variants contribute to the illness. Microdeletions and microduplications {\textgreater}100 kilobases were identified by microarray comparative genomic hybridization of genomic DNA from 150 individuals with schizophrenia and 268 ancestry-matched controls. All variants were validated by high-resolution platforms. Novel deletions and duplications of genes were present in 5{\%} of controls versus 15{\%} of cases and 20{\%} of young-onset cases, both highly significant differences. The association was independently replicated in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia as compared with their parents. Mutations in cases disrupted genes disproportionately from signaling networks controlling neurodevelopment, including neuregulin and glutamate pathways. These results suggest that multiple, individually rare mutations altering genes in neurodevelopmental pathways contribute to schizophrenia.},

The three components of the Human PhenotypeOntology (HPO; www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) project are the phenotype vocabulary, disease-phenotype annotations and the algorithms that operate on these. These components are being used for computational deep phenotyping and precision medicine as well as integration of clinical data into translational research. The HPO is being increasingly adopted as a standard for phenotypic abnormalities by diverse groups such as international rare disease organizations, registries, clinical labs, biomedical resources, and clinical software tools and will thereby contribute toward nascent efforts at global data exchange for identifying disease etiologies. This update article reviews the progress of the HPO project since the debut Nucleic Acids Research database article in 2014, including specific areas of expansion such as common (complex) disease, new algorithms for phenotype driven genomic discovery and diagnostics, integration of cross-species mapping efforts with the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, an improved quality control pipeline, and the addition of patient-friendly terminology.},

abstract = {In medical contexts, the word "phenotype" is used to refer to some deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior. The analysis of phenotype plays a key role in clinical practice and medical research, and yet phenotypic descriptions in clinical notes and medical publications are often imprecise. Deep phenotyping can be defined as the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described. The emerging field of precision medicine aims to provide the best available care for each patient based on stratification into disease subclasses with a common biological basis of disease. The comprehensive discovery of such subclasses, as well as the translation of this knowledge into clinical care, will depend critically upon computational resources to capture, store, and exchange phenotypic data, and upon sophisticated algorithms to integrate it with genomic variation, omics profiles, and other clinical information. This special issue of Human Mutation offers a number of articles describing computational solutions for current challenges in deep phenotyping, including semantic and technical standards for phenotype and disease data, digital imaging for facial phenotype analysis, model organism phenotypes, and databases for correlating phenotypes with genomic variation. 2012. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

One of the major needs in health information systems and for research is to share and/or to integrate data coming from heterogeneous sources with diverse reference terminologies. ORPHANET (www.orpha.net) is a multilingual information portal on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orphanet information system is supported by a relational database built around the concept of rare disorders. Representation of rare diseases in Orphanet encompasses levels of increasing complexity: lexical (multilingual terminology), nosological (multihierarchical classifications), relational (annotations-epidemiological data-and classes of objects-genes, manifestations, and orphan drugs-integrated in a relational database), and interoperational (semantic interoperability). Rare disorders are mapped to International Classification of Diseases (10th version), SNOMED CT, MeSH, MedDRA, and UMLS. Genes are cross-referenced with HGNC, UniProt, OMIM, and Genatlas. A suite of tools allow for extraction of massive datasets giving different views that can be used in bioinformatics to answer complex questions, intended to serve the needs of researchers and the pharmaceutical industry in developing medicinal products for rare diseases. An ontology is under development.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE - : Lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) have important roles in the field of vascular biology and are derived mainly from lysophosphatidylcholine via autotaxin. However, in our previous study, only the plasma LPA levels, and not the serum autotaxin levels, increased in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study was to elucidate the pathway by which LPA is increased in patients with ACS. APPROACH AND RESULTS - : We measured the plasma lysophospholipids species in 141 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography (ACS, n=38; stable angina pectoris, n=71; angiographically normal coronary arteries, n=32) using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Among the ACS subjects, notable increases in the 22:6 LPA, 18:2 LPA, and 20:4 LPA levels were observed. The in vitro experiments revealed that serum incubation mainly increased the 18:2 LPA level, whereas platelet activation increased the 20:4 LPA level. Minor lysophospholipids other than LPA were also elevated in ACS subjects and were well correlated with the corresponding LPA species, including 22:6 LPA. A multiple regression analysis also revealed that lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidylglycerol were independent explanatory variables for several LPA species. CONCLUSIONS - : Specific LPA species, especially long-chain unsaturated LPA, were elevated in ACS patients, along with the corresponding minor lysophospholipids. The elevation of these LPA species might be mainly caused by presently unidentified LPA-producing pathway(s). Minor lysophospholipids might be involved in the generation of LPA, especially 22:6 LPA, and in the pathogenesis of ACS.},

In the present study, we analyze the spatial expression pattern of human duplicate gene pairs by using oligonucleotide microarray data, and study the relationship between coding sequence divergence and expression divergence. First, we find a strong positive correlation between the proportion of duplicate gene pairs with divergent expression (as presence or absence of expression in a tissue) and both synonymous (KS and nonsynonymous divergence (KA). The divergence of gene expression between human duplicate genes is rapid, probably faster than that between yeast duplicates in terms of generations. Second, we compute the correlation coefficient (R) between the expression levels of duplicate genes in different tissues and find a significant negative correlation between R and KS. There is also a negative correlation between R and KA, when KA ≤ 0.2. These results indicate that protein sequence divergence and divergence of spatial expression pattern are initially coupled. Finally, we compare the functions of those duplicate genes that show rapid divergence in spatial expression pattern with the functions of those duplicate genes that show no or little divergence in spatial expression.},

abstract = {Summary: biomaRt is a new Bioconductor package that integrates BioMart data resources with data analysis software in Bioconductor. It can annotate a wide range of gene or gene product identifiers (e.g. Entrez-Gene and Affymetrix probe identifiers) with information such as gene symbol, chromosomal coordinates, Gene Ontology and OMIM annotation. Furthermore biomaRt enables retrieval of genomic sequences and single nucleotide polymorphism information, which can be used in data analysis. Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is possible as the package executes direct SQL queries to the BioMart databases (e.g. Ensembl). The biomaRt package provides a tight integration of large, public or locally installed BioMart databases with data analysis in Bioconductor creating a powerful environment for biological data mining. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

abstract = {Variations and similarities in our individual genomes are part of our history, our heritage, and our identity. Some human genomic variants are associated with common traits such as hair and eye color, while others are associated with susceptibility to disease or response to drug treatment. Identifying the human variations producing clinically relevant phenotypic changes is critical for providing accurate and personalized diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for diseases. Furthermore, a better understanding of the molecular underpinning of disease can lead to development of new drug targets for precision medicine. Several resources have been designed for collecting and storing human genomic variations in highly structured, easily accessible databases. Unfortunately, a vast amount of information about these genetic variants and their functional and phenotypic associations is currently buried in the literature, only accessible by manual curation or sophisticated text text-mining technology to extract the relevant information. In addition, the low cost of sequencing technologies coupled with increasing computational power has enabled the development of numerous computational methodologies to predict the pathogenicity of human variants. This review provides a detailed comparison of current human variant resources, including HGMD, OMIM, ClinVar, and UniProt/Swiss-Prot, followed by an overview of the computational methods and techniques used to leverage the available data to predict novel deleterious variants. We expect these resources and tools to become the foundation for understanding the molecular details of genomic variants leading to disease, which in turn will enable the promise of precision medicine. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

For health care to benefit from interpretation of genomic data, we need to know how these variants contribute to the phenotype of the individual. Research is revealing the spectrum, both in size and complexity, of structural genotypic variation, and its association with a broad range of human phenotypes. Genomic disorders associated with relatively large, recurrent contiguous variants have been recognized for some time, as have certain Mendelian traits associated with functional disruption of single genes by structural variation. More recent examples from phenotype-and genotype-driven studies demonstrate a greater level of complexity, with evidence of incremental dosage effects, gene interaction networks, buffering and modifiers, and position effects. Mechanisms underlying such variation are emerging to provide a handle on the bulk of human variation, which is associated with complex traits and adaptive potential. Interpreting genotypes for personalized health care and communicating knowledge to the individual will be significant challenges for genomics professionals.

In addition, while the notion of the genotype has received significant attention from philosophers of biology, the notion of the phenotype has not. Recent developments in the technology of measuring gene-expression levels have made it possible to conceive of phenotypic traits in terms of levels of gene expression. We demonstrate that not only has this become possible but it has also become an actual practice. This suggests a significant change in our conception of the phenotype: as in the case of the 'genotype', phenotypes can now be conceived in quantitative and measurable terms on a comprehensive molecular level. We discuss in what sense gene expression profiles can be regarded as phenotypic traits and whether these traits are better described as a novel concept of phenotype or as an extension of the classical concept. We argue for an extension of the classical concept and call for an examination of the type of extension involved. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In contrast, rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-gatherers and some pastoralists consume much less starch. This behavioral variation raises the possibility that different selective pressures have acted on amylase, the enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis. We found that copy number of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1) is correlated positively with salivary amylase protein level and that individuals from populations with high-starch diets have, on average, more AMY1 copies than those with traditionally low-starch diets. Comparisons with other loci in a subset of these populations suggest that the extent of AMY1 copy number differentiation is highly unusual. This example of positive selection on a copy number-variable gene is, to our knowledge, one of the first discovered in the human genome. Higher AMY1 copy numbers and protein levels probably improve the digestion of starchy foods and may buffer against the fitness-reducing effects of intestinal disease. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Particularly, using the DNA reference sequence as a guide, genome scanning technologies, such as microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platforms, have now enabled the detection of a previously unrecognized degree of larger-sized (non-SNP) variability in all genomes. This heterogeneity can include copy number variations (CNVs), inversions, insertions, deletions and other complex rearrangements, most of which are not detected by standard cytogenetics or DNA sequencing. Although these genomic alterations (collectively termed structural variants or polymorphisms) have been described previously, mainly through locus-specific studies, they are now known to be more global in occurrence. Moreover, as just one example, CNVs can contain entire genes and their number can correlate with the level of gene expression. It is also plausible that structural variants may commonly influence nearby genes through chromosomal positional or domain effects. Here, we discuss what is known of the prevalence of structural variants in the human genome and how they might influence phenotype, including the continuum of etiologic events underlying monogenic to complex diseases. Particularly, we highlight the newest studies and some classic examples of how structural variants might have adverse genetic consequences. We also discuss why analysis of structural variants should become a vital step in any genetic study going forward. All these progresses have set the stage for a golden era of combined microscopic and sub-microscopic (cytogenomic)-based research of chromosomes leading to a more complete understanding of the human genome.},

The role of copy number variation is well established in the pathogenesis of rare genomic disorders. More recently, germline and somatic copy number variation have been shown to be important pathogenic factors in a range of common diseases, including infectious, autoimmune and neuropsychiatric diseases and cancer. In this review, we describe the range of methods available for measuring copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals and populations, including the limitations of presently available assays, and highlight some key examples of common diseases in which CNVs have been shown clearly to have a pathogenic role. Although there has been major progress in this field in the last 5 years, understanding the full contribution of CNVs to the genetic basis of common diseases will require further studies, with more accurate CNV assays and larger cohorts than have presently been completed. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

abstract = {During the past five years, copy number variation (CNV) has emerged as a highly prevalent form of genomic variation, bridging the interval between long-recognised microscopic chromosomal alterations and single-nucleotide changes. These genomic segmental differences among humans reflect the dynamic nature of genomes, and account for both normal variations among us and variations that predispose to conditions of medical consequence. Here, we place CNVs into their historical and medical contexts, focusing on how these variations can be recognised, documented, characterised and interpreted in clinical diagnostics. We also discuss how they can cause disease or influence adaptation to an environment. Various clinical exemplars are drawn out to illustrate salient characteristics and residual enigmas of CNVs, particularly the complexity of the data and information associated with CNVs relative to that of single-nucleotide variation. The potential is immense for CNVs to explain and predict disorders and traits that have long resisted understanding. However, creative solutions are needed to manage the sudden and overwhelming burden of expectation for laboratories and clinicians to assay and interpret these complex genomic variations as awareness permeates medical practice. Challenges remain for understanding the relationship between genomic changes and the phenotypes that might be predicted and prevented by such knowledge. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2010.},

abstract = {To interpret whole exome/genome sequence data for clinical and research purposes, comprehensive phenotypic information, knowledge of pedigree structure, and results of previous clinical testing are essential. With these requirements in mind and to meet the needs of the Centers for Mendelian Genomics project, we have developed PhenoDB (http://phenodb.net), a secure, Web-based portal for entry, storage, and analysis of phenotypic and other clinical information. The phenotypic features are organized hierarchically according to the major headings and subheadings of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM{\textregistered}) clinical synopses, with further subdivisions according to structure and function. Every string allows for a free-text entry. All of the approximately 2,900 features use the preferred term from Elements of Morphology and are fully searchable and mapped to the Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology. The PhenoDB allows for ascertainment of relevant information from a case in a family or cohort, which is then searchable by family, OMIM number, phenotypic feature, mode of inheritance, genes screened, and so on. The database can also be used to format phenotypic data for submission to dbGaP for appropriately consented individuals. PhenoDB was built using Django, an open source Web development tool, and is freely available through the Johns Hopkins McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine (http://phenodb.net). {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Despite the significance of haploinsufficiency in human disease, no systematic study has been reported into the types of genes that are haploinsufficient in human, or into the mechanisms that commonly lead to their deletion and to the expression of the haploinsufficient phenotype. We have applied a rigorous text-searching and database-mining strategy to extract, as comprehensively as possible, from PubMed and OMIM an annotated list of currently known human haploinsufficient genes, including their functions and associated diseases. Gene-set enrichment analysis shows that genes-encoding transcription factors, and genes that function in development, the cell cycle, and nucleic acid metabolism are overrepresented among haploinsufficient genes in human. Many of the phenotypes associated with loss-of-function or deletion of one copy of a haploinsufficient gene describe mental retardation, developmental or metabolic disorders, or tumourigenesis. We also found that haploinsufficient genes are less likely than the complete set of human genes to be situated between pairs of segmental duplications (SDs) that are in close proximity to each other on the same chromosome. Given that SDs can initiate non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and the deletion of adjacent genomic regions, this suggests that the location of haploinsufficient genes between SD pairs, from whence they may suffer intra-genomic rearrangement and loss, is selectively disadvantageous. We describe a custom-made Java visualization tool, HaploGeneMapper, to aid in visualizing the proximity of human haploinsufficient genes to SDs and to enable identification of haploinsufficient genes that are vulnerable to NAHR-mediated deletion.},

This problem is especially critical and challenging for rare diseases, where publications of large series are scarce. Through an applied example, we illustrate how to automatically identify new relevant cases and semantically annotate the relevant literature about patient case reports to capture the phenotype of a rare disease named cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Results: Our results confirm that it is possible to automatically identify new relevant case reports with a high precision and to annotate them with a satisfactory quality (74{\%} F-measure).

abstract = {Genomic rearrangements describe gross DNA changes of the size ranging from a couple of hundred base pairs, the size of an average exon, to megabases (Mb). When greater than 3 to 5 Mb, such changes are usually visible microscopically by chromosome studies. Human diseases that result from genomic rearrangements have been called genomic disorders. Three major mechanisms have been proposed for genomic rearrangements in the human genome. Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is mostly mediated by low-copy repeats (LCRs) with recombination hotspots, gene conversion and apparent minimal efficient processing segments. NAHR accounts for most of the recurrent rearrangements: those that share a common size, show clustering of breakpoints, and recur in multiple individuals. Non-recurrent rearrangements are of different sizes in each patient, but may share a smallest region of overlap whose change in copy number may result in shared clinical features among different patients. LCRs do not mediate, but may stimulate non-recurrent events. Some rare NAHRs can also be mediated by highly homologous repetitive sequences (for example, Alu, LINE); these NAHRs account for some of the non-recurrent rearrangements. Other non-recurrent rearrangements can be explained by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and the Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) models. These mechanisms occur both in germ cells, where the rearrangements can be associated with genomic disorders, and in somatic cells in which such genomic rearrangements can cause disorders such as cancer. NAHR, NHEJ and FoSTeS probably account for the majority of genomic rearrangements in our genome and the frequency distribution of the three at a given locus may partially reflect the genomic architecture in proximity to that locus. We provide a review of the current understanding of these three models.},

abstract = {Cytogenetic studies have demonstrated that duplications or deletions of entire chromosomes or microscopically visible aberrations are associated with specific congenital disorders. The subsequent development and application of microarray-based assays have established the importance of copy number variants (CNV) as a substantial source of genetic diversity in the human genome. Pathogenic CNVs are associated not only with birth defects and cancers, but also with neurodevelopmental disorders at birth or neurodegenerative diseases in adulthood. Unfortunately, the limited knowledge of the phenotypic effects of most CNVs has led to the classification of many CNVs as genomic imbalances of unknown clinical significance. This has caused many clinicians to resist the introduction of microarray technologies in detecting CNVs in a genome-wide manner for prenatal applications. This review summarises our current understanding of CNVs, the common detection methods, and the implications for human health and prenatal diagnosis. {\textcopyright} RCOG 2010 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.},

abstract = {Bioactive phospholipids, which include sphingosine-1-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, ceramide and their derivatives regulate a wide variety of cellular functions in culture such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The availability of these lipids and their products is regulated by the lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). Here we show that mouse embryos deficient for LPP3 fail to form a chorio-allantoic placenta and yolk sac vasculature. A subset of embryos also show a shortening of the anterior-posterior axis and frequent duplication of axial structures that are strikingly similar to the phenotypes associated with axin deficiency, a critical regulator of Wnt signaling. Loss of LPP3 results in a marked increase in $\beta$-catenin-mediated TCF transcription, whereas elevated levels of LPP3 inhibit $\beta$-catenin-mediated TCF transcription. LPP3 also inhibits axis duplication and leads to mild ventralization in Xenopus embryo development. Although LPP3 null fibroblasts show altered levels of bioactive phospholipids, consistent with loss of LPP3 phosphatase activity, mutant forms of LPP3, specifically lacking phosphatase activity, were able to inhibit $\beta$-catenin-mediated TCF transcription and also suppress axis duplication, although not as effectively as intact LPP3. These results reveal that LPP3 is essential to formation of the chorio-allantoic placenta and extra-embryonic vasculature. LPP3 also mediates gastrulation and axis formation, probably by influencing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The exact biochemical roles of LPP3 phosphatase activity and its undefined effect on $\beta$-catenin-mediated TCF transcription remain to be determined.},

METHODS: Thirteen different copy number changes, detected by array comparative genomic hybridization, that have not been associated with an abnormal phenotype in the literature were evaluated by directors from 11 different clinical laboratories to determine how they would interpret and report the findings. RESULTS: For none of the thirteen copy number changes was there complete agreement in the interpretation of the clinical significance of the deletion or duplication. For some cases, the interpretations ranged from normal to abnormal. CONCLUSION: There is a need for more specific guidelines for interpreting and reporting copy number changes detected by array-based technology to clearly and more consistently communicate the clinical significance of these findings to ordering providers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enabled the investigation of the rare variant-common disease hypothesis in unrelated individuals, even on the genome-wide level. Analysis of this hypothesis requires tailored statistical methods as single marker tests fail on rare variants. An entire class of statistical methods collapses rare variants from a genomic region of interest (ROI), thereby aggregating rare variants. In an extensive simulation study using data from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 we compared the performance of 15 collapsing methods by means of a variety of pre-defined ROIs regarding minor allele frequency thresholds and functionality. Findings of the simulation study were additionally confirmed by a real data set investigating the association between methotrexate clearance and the SLCO1B1 gene in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our analyses showed substantially inflated type I error levels for many of the proposed collapsing methods. Only four approaches yielded valid type I errors in all considered scenarios. None of the statistical tests was able to detect true associations over a substantial proportion of replicates in the simulated data. Detailed annotation of functionality of variants is crucial to detect true associations. These findings were confirmed in the analysis of the real data. Recent theoretical work showed that large power is achieved in gene-based analyses only if large sample sizes are available and a substantial proportion of causing rare variants is present in the gene-based analysis. Many of the investigated statistical approaches use permutation requiring high computational cost. There is a clear need for valid, powerful and fast to calculate test statistics for studies investigating rare variants.},

abstract = {The term "precision medicine" has become very popular over recent years, fuelled by scientific as well as political perspectives. Despite its popularity, its exact meaning, and how it is different from other popular terms such as "stratified medicine", "targeted therapy" or "deep phenotyping" remains unclear. Commonly applied definitions focus on the stratification of patients, sometimes referred to as a novel taxonomy, and this is derived using large-scale data including clinical, lifestyle, genetic and further biomarker information, thus going beyond the classical "signs-and-symptoms" approach.While these aspects are relevant, this description leaves open a number of questions. For example, when does precision medicine begin? In which way does the stratification of patients translate into better healthcare? And can precision medicine be viewed as the end-point of a novel stratification of patients, as implied, or is it rather a greater whole?To clarify this, the aim of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive definition that focuses on precision medicine as a process. It will be shown that this proposed framework incorporates the derivation of novel taxonomies and their role in healthcare as part of the cycle, but also covers related terms.},

abstract = {Many patients suffering from developmental disorders harbor submicroscopic deletions or duplications that, by affecting the copy number of dosage-sensitive genes or disrupting normal gene expression, lead to disease. However, many aberrations are novel or extremely rare, making clinical interpretation problematic and genotype-phenotype correlations uncertain. Identification of patients sharing a genomic rearrangement and having phenotypic features in common leads to greater certainty in the pathogenic nature of the rearrangement and enables new syndromes to be defined. To facilitate the analysis of these rare events, we have developed an interactive web-based database called DECIPHER (Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources) which incorporates a suite of tools designed to aid the interpretation of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance, inversions, and translocations. DECIPHER catalogs common copy-number changes in normal populations and thus, by exclusion, enables changes that are novel and potentially pathogenic to be identified. DECIPHER enhances genetic counseling by retrieving relevant information from a variety of bioinformatics resources. Known and predicted genes within an aberration are listed in the DECIPHER patient report, and genes of recognized clinical importance are highlighted and prioritized. DECIPHER enables clinical scientists worldwide to maintain records of phenotype and chromosome rearrangement for their patients and, with informed consent, share this information with the wider clinical research community through display in the genome browser Ensembl. By sharing cases worldwide, clusters of rare cases having phenotype and structural rearrangement in common can be identified, leading to the delineation of new syndromes and furthering understanding of gene function. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Copy number variation (CNV) of DNA sequences is functionally significant but has yet to be fully ascertained. We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number variable regions (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12{\%} of the genome) were identified in these populations. These CNVRs contained hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements and segmental duplications. Notably, the CNVRs encompassed more nucleotide content per genome than SNPs, underscoring the importance of CNV in genetic diversity and evolution. The data obtained delineate linkage disequilibrium patterns for many CNVs, and reveal marked variation in copy number among populations. We also demonstrate the utility of this resource for genetic disease studies. {\textcopyright}2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

OMIM is based on the published peer-reviewed biomedical literature and is used by overlapping and diverse communities of clinicians, molecular biologists and genome scientists, as well as by students and teachers of these disciplines. Genes and phenotypes are described in separate entries and are given unique, stable six-digit identifiers (MIM numbers). OMIM entries have a structured free-text format that provides the flexibility necessary to describe the complex and nuanced relationships between genes and genetic phenotypes in an efficient manner. OMIM also has a derivative table of genes and genetic phenotypes, the Morbid Map. OMIM.org has enhanced search capabilities such as genome coordinate searching and thesaurus-enhanced search term options. Phenotypic series have been created to facilitate viewing genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes. Clinical synopsis features are enhanced with UMLS, Human Phenotype Ontology and Elements of Morphology terms and image links. All OMIM data are available for FTP download and through an API.

abstract = {Structural variations of DNA greater than 1 kilobase in size account for most bases that vary among human genomes, but are still relatively under-ascertained. Here we use tiling oligonucleotide microarrays, comprising 42 million probes, to generate a comprehensive map of 11,700 copy number variations (CNVs) greater than 443 base pairs, of which most (8,599) have been validated independently. For 4,978 of these CNVs, we generated reference genotypes from 450 individuals of European, African or East Asian ancestry. The predominant mutational mechanisms differ among CNV size classes. Retrotransposition has duplicated and inserted some coding and non-coding DNA segments randomly around the genome. Furthermore, by correlation with known trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified 30 loci with CNVs that are candidates for influencing disease susceptibility. Despite this, having assessed the completeness of our map and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium between CNVs and SNPs, we conclude that, for complex traits, the heritability void left by genome-wide association studies will not be accounted for by common CNVs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Changes in membrane voltage brought about by ion fluxes through voltage and transmitter-gated channels represent the basis of neural activity. As such, electrochemical gradients across the membrane determine the direction and driving force for the flow of ions and are therefore crucial in setting the properties of synaptic transmission and signal propagation. Ion concentration gradients are established by a variety of mechanisms, including specialized transporter proteins. However, transmembrane gradients can be affected by ionic fluxes through channels during periods of elevated neural activity, which in turn are predicted to influence the properties of on-going synaptic transmission. Such activity-induced changes to ion concentration gradients are a feature of both physiological and pathological neural processes. An epileptic seizure is an example of severely perturbed neural activity, which is accompanied by pronounced changes in intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations. Appreciating the factors that contribute to these ion dynamics is critical if we are to understand how a seizure event evolves and is sustained and terminated by neural tissue. Indeed, this issue is of significant clinical importance as status epilepticus—a type of seizure that does not stop of its own accord—is a life-threatening medical emergency. In this review we explore how the transmembrane concentration gradient of the six major ions (K+, Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, H+and HCO-3) is altered during an epileptic seizure. We will first examine each ion individually, before describing how multiple interacting mechanisms between ions might contribute to concentration changes and whether these act to prolong or terminate epileptic activity. In doing so, we will consider how the availability of experimental techniques has both advanced and restricted our ability to study these phenomena.},

The symposium drew upon the tools and expertise from multiple disciplines and diverse geographical regions and consisted of 24 original research presentations and an interdisciplinary roundtable. Specific attention was paid to the bioethical, material and lived dimensions of recent developments in molecular technologies, and discussions interrogated the complex ways in which the 'molecular realm' is an emerging site for constituting human identities in the 21st century. Herein we summarize some of the key findings of the conference and raise three further issues for practitioners and researchers to consider in relation to the broader impact of genetics research.

Here, we examine the possibility that rare de novo copy number (CN) mutations with relatively high penetrance contribute to the genetic component of schizophrenia. We carried out a whole-genome scan and implemented a number of steps for finding and confirming CN mutations. Confirmed de novo mutations were significantly associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.00078) and were collectively ∼8 times more frequent in sporadic (but not familial) cases with schizophrenia than in unaffected controls. In comparison, rare inherited CN mutations were only modestly enriched in sporadic cases. Our results suggest that rare de novo germline mutations contribute to schizophrenia vulnerability in sporadic cases and that rare genetic lesions at many different loci can account, at least in part, for the genetic heterogeneity of this disease. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

However, the clinical interpretation of CNVs remains challenging, especially for inherited CNVs. Well-phenotyped patients (5,531) with ID/MCA were screened for rare CNVs using a 250K single-nucleotide polymorphism array platform in order to improve the understanding of the contribution of CNVs to a patients phenotype. We detected 1,663 rare CNVs in 1,388 patients (25.1{\%}; range 0-5 per patient) of which 437 occurred de novo and 638 were inherited. The detected CNVs were analyzed for various characteristics, gene content, and genotype-phenotype correlations. Patients with severe phenotypes, including organ malformations, had more de novo CNVs (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas patient groups with milder phenotypes, such as facial dysmorphisms, were enriched for both de novo and inherited CNVs (P {\textless} 0.001), indicating that not only de novo but also inherited CNVs can be associated with a clinically relevant phenotype. Moreover, patients with multiple CNVs presented with a more severe phenotype than patients with a single CNV (P {\textless} 0.001), pointing to a combinatorial effect of the additional CNVs. In addition, we identified 20 de novo single-gene CNVs that directly indicate novel genes for ID/MCA, including ZFHX4, ANKH, DLG2, MPP7, CEP89, TRIO, ASTN2, and PIK3C3. {\textcopyright} 2013 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.},

This information could be useful to guide targeted therapy and prevent pathologic outcomes.

With rapid growth in genetic data and the requirements for new paradigms for complex disorders comes the need to train professionals to understand and manage the impact of genetic information on patients within these clinical settings. Here we describe the challenges, controversies, and opportunities for genetics and genetic counselors in managing complex disorders and discuss the rationale for modifications in genetic counselor training and function.
